\section{Introduction}

These notes are the documentation of the research on machine learning methods lead during the development of an engine for facial emotion recognition for the course on Machine Learning at the University of Hamburg. This document aims to give an overview on the current context of Machine Learning and then it focuses on presenting the algorithms implemented in the engine (KNN, SVM, AdaBoost and CNN); it explains how they work, their advantages and disadvantages.
