\section{Neural Networks and Deep Learning}


\subsection{Convolutional Neural Networks CNN}

A Convolutional Neural Network is a Deep Learning algorithm which is primarily used to classify images. It can more easily capture spatial (and temporal) dependencies since the convolution filters use a linear combination of neighboring pixels to calculate an output value. After a convolution filter is applied, a Max-Pooling filter can be applied, which lowers the amount of nodes in the network. A $2$x$2$ Max-Pooling filter, for example, replaces every $2$x$2$ square with the maximal value in that square, resulting in lowering the amount of nodes after that layer to a quarter.
At the end the multidimensional layers are flattened to a one dimensional vector that is connected to the output via a fully connected layer.

\subsection{Recurrent Neural Networks RNN}

A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a type of artificial neural network commonly used in speech recognition and natural language processing. It uses feedback loops, that allow information to persist (the network has memory), to process sequences of data.

\subsection{Generative adversarial networks GAN}

Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are algorithmic architectures that use two neural networks, pitting one against the other in order to generate new, synthetic instances of data that can pass for real data. They are used widely in image generation, video generation and voice generation.\\
One neural network, called the generator, generates new data instances, while the other, the discriminator, evaluates them for authenticity; i.e. the discriminator decides whether each instance of data that it reviews belongs to the actual training dataset or not.\\

\subsection{Autoencoders}

Autoencoders are a specific type of feedforward neural networks where the input is the same as the output. They compress the input into a lower-dimensional code and then reconstruct the output from this representation. The code is a compact “summary” or “compression” of the input.
An autoencoder consists of 3 components: encoder, code and decoder. The encoder compresses the input and produces the code, the decoder then reconstructs the input only using this code.
