Meeting 28.05.2020 at 14:30. Doku: Giulia

Timo presented the document (ML_Project) that Max prepared on our redefined goals.
Dr.Beckmann asked which algorithms we were willing to cover as our "research goal". 
Timo moved to "ML-Methods" and over the diagram in chapter2. 
He pointed that our focus is on Supervised classical learning and Neural Nets/Deep Learning, which are the methods useful for our "implementing goal" of building a classifier for facial emotions.  

Following, we discussed on planning. 
Timo mentioned our available time: each week 8h/person of which 1h/meeting and 30min/client.
Giulia mentioned organizing a table in which after each group meeting we make notes on our progress. 
Plus another table in which each group member is associated to his tasks and due date. 
Still not having it prepared, we mentioned our current "fast" approach on having a task for this week. 
Dr.Beckmann asked for a complete planning for the whole project with defined tasks, milestones, dependencies, time requirement and assignment and suggested using a Gantt chart.  
He asked we have it done next week, we settled Mo.01 for preparing and discussing on Mo.02.
