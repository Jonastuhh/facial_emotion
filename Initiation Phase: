Initiation Phase:

What are the Goals of the project?
1.) Learn how to program a simple machine learning algorithm.
2.) Learn how to decide which algorithm to use for our problem. (advantages / disadvantages)
3.) Learn how to decide on the numbers of nodes and layers of neural networks.
4.) Understand the technique behind our choice of machine learning algorithm.
5.) Learn how to work in a team in projet work

Make these goals 'SMART'
1.) Have any kind of machine learning algorithm that classifies the emotion on an input image. 
2.) List advantages and disadvanteges of different machine learning algorithm for our problem and decide on which algorithm is best suitable for our problem.
3.) Research on how many nodes and layers are best for a given problem (more general, if we dont choose a neural network)
4.) Understand the choice made in 2.) how does the algorithm classify new input images and how does it learn. (visualize steps by comparing to our own code)

What are possible steps to archive these goals?
- Start with step 2.) to get an overview over the possible algorithms to use. (Research)
- Continue with step 4.) by doing more research.
- Continue with step 1.) and if a neural network is chosen research on the optimal parameters for our method (step 3.)) 

What are the risks and assumptions?
- Finding a suitable training set
